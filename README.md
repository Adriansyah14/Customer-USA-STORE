# Customer-USA-STORE ðŸŒŽ

## Background & about Data

In the competitive landscape of online retail, understanding customer behavior and demographics is essential for driving business success. USA STORE, a fictional online retail business, has accumulated a wealth of transactional data that can provide valuable insights into customer profiles and purchasing patterns. This dataset includes key customer attributes such as gender, age, employment status, and other related information.

To emulate a real-world business scenario, this project aims to leverage SQL as a primary tool to extract, analyze, and interpret data from USA STOREâ€™s transactions. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can inform business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth.

## Result Analysis
- Customer data reveals that the number of female customers exceeds that of male customers by 19%.  It means that the items available at USA STORE are more in demand by female customers. Add a variety of products that are popular among male customers to increase sales.
- Most of our customers are over 40 years old, so the average age of all customers is 47 years. To increase younger customers, we can review the UI/UX display. Adjust the UI/UX display to be practical, contemporary, and attractive to them. In addition, actively promote on social media favored by younger customers, such as Instagram and TikTok.
- PayPal has become the most popular payment method favored by customers for making transactions at USA STORE, followed by Card, and other methods. With the popularity of PayPal, USA STORE companies must routinely check this payment method to avoid errors that can affect sales or transactions.
- Montana ($1567.45), Rhode Island ($1527.16), and Arizona ($1508.63) are the states with the highest amount spent per customer. However, Montana and Rhode Island are not even in the top 10 states with the highest number of transactions. This means that a high volume of orders in a state doesn't necessarily translate to customers in that state spending a lot of money overall.
