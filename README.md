# Customer-USA-STORE ðŸŒŽ

## Background & about Data

In the competitive landscape of online retail, understanding customer behavior and demographics is essential for driving business success. USA STORE, a fictional online retail business, has accumulated a wealth of transactional data that can provide valuable insights into customer profiles and purchasing patterns. This dataset includes key customer attributes such as gender, age, employment status, and other related information.

To emulate a real-world business scenario, this project aims to leverage SQL as a primary tool to extract, analyze, and interpret data from USA STOREâ€™s transactions. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can inform business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth.

## Result Analysis
  <> Customer data reveals that the number of female customers exceeds that of male customers by 19%.  It means that the items available at USA STORE are more in demand by female customers. Add a variety of products that are popular among       male customers to increase sales.
  <> Most of our customers are over 40 years old, so the average age of all customers is 47 years. To increase younger customers, we can review the UI/UX display. Adjust the UI/UX display to be practical, contemporary, and attractive to         them. In addition, actively promote on social media favored by younger customers, such as Instagram and TikTok.
  <> PayPal has become the most popular payment method favored by customers for making transactions at USA STORE, followed by Card, and other methods. With the popularity of PayPal, USA STORE companies must routinely check this payment           method to avoid errors that can affect sales or transactions.
  <> Montana ($1567.45), Rhode Island ($1527.16), and Arizona ($1508.63) are the states with the highest amount spent per customer. However, Montana and Rhode Island are not even in the top 10 states with the highest number of                   transactions. This means that a high volume of orders in a state doesn't necessarily translate to customers in that state spending a lot of money overall.
  <> Customers in different states may have different shopping habits. Some may prefer to make frequent, smaller purchases, while others may prefer to make less frequent, larger purchases.
  <> Basic memberships represent the largest customer segment with a total of 1052 members. This number is almost equal to the combined total of all other membership tiers (Silver, Platinum, Gold, and Missing), which is 1226. The high           number of Basic memberships could be due to many customers being dissatisfied with their transaction experience at USA STORE, leading them to make only a few purchases. This could be further investigated if customer rating data were         available.
  <> The more customers there are in a membership segment, the more profit is obtained.
  <> There's not a significant difference in average spending between single and married customers, with married customers spending slightly more.
  <> Customers who register through referrals do not spend more than customers who register without referrals. The average spend of both is relatively almost the same, with without referrals slightly superior.
